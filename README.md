- 👋 Hi, I’m @stampe99, aka stampe, I'm a swedish programmer. 

- 📂 Languages I know are: Python, JavaScript, Html & CSS. 

- 🗒️ I mainly focus on backend developement such as websites, I'm also interested in website security & vulnerables. 

- 📌 Feel free to invite me to any of your projects if you want help! 

- 👨‍💻 A chrome extension I use for github and that I recomend is a file icon package that changes the folder icon on files to the language icon, it can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/file-icons-for-github-and/ficfmibkjjnpogdcfhfokmihanoldbfe/related)
